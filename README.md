# portfolio-management
Full Stack development project based on portfolio management
The Financial Portfolio Management System is a streamlined application designed to manage financial portfolios through a RESTful API. Built with Spring Boot and Java, it utilizes Spring Framework for robust backend development and H2 Database for in-memory data storage. The project follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, ensuring high code quality with JUnit and Mockito. Docker is used for containerization, while Jenkins handles CI/CD processes, automating builds and deployments. The motive behind this project is to demonstrate the ability to integrate modern development practices and technologies into a cohesive solution that can be scaled and maintained efficiently. Through this project, I have gained hands-on experience in building scalable applications, implementing CI/CD pipelines, and utilizing containerization for streamlined deployment, enhancing both my technical skills and understanding of industry-standard development workflows.
